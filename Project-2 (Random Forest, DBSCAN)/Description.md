# Project Description
A project to predict the value of securities on the stock market. The full version consists of two main parts: the nlp part, which analyzes the bloomberg news site, finds news related to the analyzed securities on it, after which, based on nlp methods, it extracts the expert's name and the date or period of the forecast for the security from the news text; the forecasting part based on a random forest, and DBSCAN, which eliminates abnormal data and determining the need to retrain the forecasting model. Only the second part is presented in this repository, in view of the execution of the first by another person who did not want his work to be posted. The project is executed in swift and python. All machine learning methods are implemented from scratch.

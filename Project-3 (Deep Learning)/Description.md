# Project Description
A project to create sentences similar to the input in meaning. It can create an unlimited number of similar sentences based on the input, by masking part of the words and selecting them using Bert, either by deleting part of the input sentence and supplementing it using GPT-2, or using a combination of the described approaches. The number of sentences generated in the course of work is controlled based on the minimum percentage of coincidence set by the user. The percentage of coincidence of the meanings of sentences is obtained using Bert trained for stsb tasks. The project is executed in python.
